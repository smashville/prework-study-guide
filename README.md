# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to see if I was able to use the information I've learned on coding so far, to create my very own first webpage.
I built this project to have easy and quick access to different topics I've learned in coding.
It solves the problem of me having to hunt for this information online when I can simply navigate to my page to find it.
I learned the basics of HTML and how it is the code that is used to structure a webpage and it's content.
I also learned about CSS and how it styles web content such as a red text or location of certain content.
I've also learned about Git - an open-source version control system where everty developer has the full history of their code repository locally. 
Finally, Javascript - a programming language that adds interactivity to your webpage. This ranges from data entry on forms, animation, games, etc.
